# Snake Game: Update Log

## Project Overview
This repository documents the development of a Snake Game built using Python and the Turtle module. Each update corresponds to a significant milestone in the creation of the game, showcasing progressive implementation of features and functionality.

---

## Update 1: Setting Up the Screen and Creating the Snake
**Date:** 20250119

- **Objective:** Initialize the game screen and create the snake's starting segments.
- **Steps Completed:**
  1. Set up a black game screen with a 600x600 pixel dimension.
  2. Created three initial snake segments using Turtle objects positioned at specific coordinates.
- **Code Highlights:**
  ```python
  screen = Screen()
  screen.setup(width=600, height=600)
  screen.bgcolor("black")
  screen.title("My Snake Game")

  starting_positions = ((0, 0), (-20, 0), (-40, 0))
  for position in starting_positions:
      new_segment = Turtle("square")
      new_segment.color("white")
      new_segment.goto(position)
  ```

---

## Update 2: Moving the Snake
**Date:** 20250119

- **Objective:** Enable the snake to move continuously in the game space.
- **Steps Completed:**
  1. Implemented a list to store the snake segments for movement tracking.
  2. Configured a game loop using `while` to update the screen and move the snake.
  3. Added functionality for each segment to follow the one in front, simulating snake movement.
  4. Introduced a slight delay between screen updates to create a smooth movement effect.
- **Code Highlights:**
  ```python
  screen.tracer(0)            # Stops constant screen refresh
  segments = []
  for position in starting_positions:
      new_segment = Turtle("square")
      new_segment.color("white")
      new_segment.penup()     # Removes lines between segments
      new_segment.goto(position)
      segments.append(new_segment)

  game_is_on = True
  while game_is_on:
      screen.update()         # Refresh screen only once per loop
      time.sleep(0.1)         # Pause to control snake speed

      for seg_num in range(len(segments) - 1, 0, -1):
          new_x = segments[seg_num - 1].xcor()
          new_y = segments[seg_num - 1].ycor()
          segments[seg_num].goto(new_x, new_y)
      segments[0].forward(20)
  ```

## Update 2.5: Modularization with the Snake Class
**Date:** 20250119

- **Objective:** Refactor the snake logic into a standalone `Snake` class for modularity and reusability.
- **Steps Completed:**
  1. Created a `Snake` class in a separate `snake.py` file.
  2. Moved the snake creation and movement logic into methods of the `Snake` class.
  3. Updated the main game file to use the `Snake` class, simplifying the game loop.
- **Code Highlights:**
  - **`snake.py`**
    ```python
    from turtle import Turtle
    STARTING_POSITIONS = ((0, 0), (-20, 0), (-40, 0))
    MOVE_DISTANCE = 20

    class Snake:

        def __init__(self):
            self.segments = []      # Create the snake through a loop via segments
            self.create_snake()

        def create_snake(self):
            for position in STARTING_POSITIONS:
                new_segment = Turtle("square")
                new_segment.color("white")
                new_segment.penup() # Fixes the weird thin line between segments when snake moves
                new_segment.goto(position)
                self.segments.append(new_segment)

        def move(self):
            for seg_num in range(len(self.segments) - 1, 0, -1):  # Move each snake segment
                new_x = self.segments[seg_num - 1].xcor()
                new_y = self.segments[seg_num - 1].ycor()
                self.segments[seg_num].goto(new_x, new_y)
            self.segments[0].forward(MOVE_DISTANCE)
    ```

  - **`main.py`**
    ```python
    import time
    from turtle import Screen

    from snake import Snake

    screen = Screen()
    screen.setup(width=600, height=600)
    screen.bgcolor("black")
    screen.title("My Snake Game")
    screen.tracer(0)

    snake = Snake()

    game_is_on = True
    while game_is_on:
        screen.update()         # Refresh screen btwn snake movements
        time.sleep(0.1)         # Adds delay btwn movements before screen refresh

        snake.move()
    
    screen.exitonclick()
    ```

## Update 3: Controlling the Snake
**Date:** 20250120

- **Objective:** Implement keyboard controls to change the snake's direction.
- **Steps Completed:**
  1. Configured the game to listen for keyboard inputs using `screen.listen()`.
  2. Added key bindings to control the snake's direction using the arrow keys.
  3. Updated the `Snake` class with methods to handle directional changes (`move_up`, `move_down`, `move_left`, `move_right`).
  4. Incorporated conditional logic to prevent the snake from reversing direction.
- **Code Highlights:**
  - **`main.py`**
    ```python
    screen.listen()
    screen.onkey(snake.move_up, "Up")
    screen.onkey(snake.move_down, "Down")
    screen.onkey(snake.move_left, "Left")
    screen.onkey(snake.move_right, "Right")
    ```

  - **`snake.py`**
    ```python
    UP = 90
    DOWN = 270
    LEFT = 180
    RIGHT = 0

    class Snake:
        ...

        def move_up(self):
            if self.head.heading() != DOWN:
                self.segments[0].setheading(UP)

        def move_down(self):
            if self.head.heading() != UP:
                self.segments[0].setheading(DOWN)

        def move_left(self):
            if self.head.heading() != RIGHT:
                self.segments[0].setheading(LEFT)

        def move_right(self):
            if self.head.heading() != LEFT:
                self.segments[0].setheading(RIGHT)
    ```

## Update 4: Detecting Collision with Food

**Date**: 20250203

- **Objective**: Implement food spawning and collision detection with the snake.
- **Steps Completed**:
  1.	Created a Food class in a new food.py file.
  2.	Utilized class inheritance by making Food a subclass of the Turtle class.
  3.	Overrode the __init__ method of Turtle to customize the appearance and behavior of the food.
  4.	Implemented the refresh() method to randomly reposition the food on the screen upon collision detection.
  5.	Integrated food collision detection into main.py using the distance() method from the Turtle class.

####	Understanding Class Inheritance in Food Class:
The Food class inherits from the Turtle class, allowing it to use all the built-in methods and attributes of a Turtle object while modifying its behavior specifically for food mechanics.

#### How Inheritance Works Here:
-	The `super().__init__()` call invokes the constructor of the parent Turtle class, initializing the food object as a Turtle.
-	By inheriting from Turtle, the Food class gains access to all Turtle methods, such as `.shape()`, `.penup()`, `.color()`, `.goto()`, and `.speed()`.
-	The Food class customizes these properties to make the food appear as a small, blue circle and move instantly when repositioned.

#### Code Highlights

- [NEW] **`food.py`** (Creating the Food Class with Inheritance)
  ```py
  from turtle import Turtle
  import random

  class Food(Turtle):  # Inherits from Turtle class
      def __init__(self):
          super().__init__()  # Calls the Turtle class constructor
          self.shape("circle")  
          self.penup()  # Prevents food from drawing lines  
          self.shapesize(stretch_len=0.5, stretch_wid=0.5)  # Makes food smaller  
          self.color("blue")  
          self.speed("fastest")  # Instantly moves when repositioned  
          self.refresh()  # Places food at a random location when initialized  

      def refresh(self):
          """Moves food to a new random location within the game boundaries."""
          random_x = random.randint(-280, 280)
          random_y = random.randint(-280, 280)
          self.goto(random_x, random_y)  # Uses Turtle's built-in .goto() method
  ```

- [MODIFIED] **`main.py`** (Detecting Collision with Food and Repositioning It)

  ```py
  # Create an instance of the Food class
  food = Food()

  # Inside the game loop, check for collision with food
  if snake.head.distance(food) < 15:  # If the snake's head is within 15 pixels of food
      print("nom nom nom")  # Placeholder for future scorekeeping
      food.refresh()  # Moves food to a new random location
  ```


#### Key Takeaways from this Update:
-	The Food class is a subclass of Turtle, inheriting all of its attributes and methods.
-	The `super().__init__()` method ensures that the Food object is properly initialized as a Turtle instance.
-	The `.refresh()` method allows the food to respawn at a new random location whenever the snake eats it.
-	The `distance()` method from Turtle is used to detect when the snake collides with food.

## Update 5: Adding a Scoreboard and Detecting Collisions

#### Date: 20250220

- **Objective:** Implement a scoring system and begin handling collisions with walls.

- **Steps Completed:**
  1. Created a new Scoreboard class in a separate scoreboard.py file.
  2. Displayed the score dynamically on the screen using Turtleâ€™s write() method.
  3. Increased the score whenever the snake successfully eats food.
  4. Began setting up collision detection with screen boundaries (logic to be completed).


#### Code Highlights:

-	[NEW] `scoreboard.py`

    ```py
    from turtle import Turtle

    class Scoreboard(Turtle):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__()
            self.score = 0
            self.color("white")
            self.penup()
            self.hideturtle()
            self.goto(0, 270)
            self.update_score()

        def update_score(self):
            self.clear()
            self.write(f"Score: {self.score}", align="center", font=("Courier", 24, "normal"))

        def increase_score(self):
            self.score += 1
            self.update_score()
    ```

-	[UPDATED] `main.py` 

    ```py
    from scoreboard import Scoreboard

    scoreboard = Scoreboard()

    if snake.head.distance(food) < 15:
        print("*nom nom nom*")
        scoreboard.increase_score()
        food.refresh()
    ```

## Update 6: Collision Detection with Walls (Game Over Condition)

#### Date: 20250222

- **Objective:** End the game when the snake collides with the wall.

- **Steps Completed:**
  1. Added logic to detect when the snake's head crosses the screen boundaries.
  2. Displayed a "GAME OVER" message both on-screen and in the console.
  3. Integrated the collision detection within the main game loop.

- **Code Highlights:**

  - **`main.py`**
    ```python
    # main.py
    if snake.head.xcor() > 280 or snake.head.xcor() < -280 or snake.head.ycor() > 280 or snake.head.ycor() < -280:
        game_is_on = False
        scoreboard.game_over()
    ```

  - **`scoreboard.py`**
    ```py
    def game_over(self):
        self.goto(0, 0)
        self.write("GAME OVER", align=ALIGNMENT, font=FONT)
        print(f"GAME OVER. Final Score: {self.score}")
    ```

## Update 7: Extending the Snake and Detecting Self-Collision

**Date:** 20250221

- **Objective:** Enable the snake to grow upon consuming food and implement collision detection with its own body to end the game.

- **Steps Completed:**
  1. Added an `extend()` method in the `Snake` class to increase the snakeâ€™s length by adding a new segment at the tail.
  2. Used list slicing to streamline the movement logic, making it more efficient by updating all segments' positions simultaneously.
  3. Implemented a self-collision detection mechanism that ends the game when the snake's head collides with any part of its body.
  4. **Refactored `create_snake()` in `snake.py`**: Moved segment creation logic into a separate reusable `add_segment()` method for better code reusability and maintainability.

- **Efficiency Improvements Using Slicing:**

  - The logic now uses Python's slice assignment to shift segment positions effectively, avoiding the need for a manual loop.
  - This reduces the complexity of moving segments and improves performance, especially as the snake grows longer.

#### Code Highlights

- **`main.py`**
  ```py
  for segment in snake.segments[1:]: # ? Skips the head
    if snake.head.distance(segment) < 10:
        game_is_on = False
        print("Collided with tail!")
        scoreboard.game_over()
  ```

- **`snake.py`**
  ```python
  def extend(self):
      self.add_segment(self.segments[-1].position())

  def detect_self_collision(self):
      for segment in self.segments[1:]:
          if self.head.distance(segment) < 10:
              return True
      return False

  def move(self):
      for seg_num in range(len(self.segments) - 1, 0, -1):
          self.segments[seg_num].goto(self.segments[seg_num - 1].pos())
      self.head.forward(MOVE_DISTANCE)
  ```

## Update 8: Adding a High Score Feature

**Date:** 20250314

**Objective:** Implement a high score feature and enhance the user experience with improved snake movement.

### Steps Completed:
1. Changed movement controls from arrow keys to W-A-S-D for a more natural user experience.
2. Added high score tracking to retain the highest score across sessions.
   - The game no longer terminates upon collision.
3. Instead of ending the game when the snake collides with a wall or its own tail, a new three-segment snake will respawn.

### Code Highlights

#### `main.py`
```py
# 3. Control the Snake (UPDATED: Using W-A-S-D instead of arrow keys)
screen.listen()
screen.onkeypress(snake.move_up, "w")
screen.onkeypress(snake.move_down, "s")
screen.onkeypress(snake.move_left, "a")
screen.onkeypress(snake.move_right, "d")

game_is_on = True
while game_is_on:
    # 6. Detect collision with wall (Reset Game State)
    if (
        snake.head.xcor() > 280
        or snake.head.xcor() < -280
        or snake.head.ycor() > 280
        or snake.head.ycor() < -280
    ):
        scoreboard.reset()  # Retains high score, resets current score
        snake.reset()       # Restart with a new snake

    # 7. Detect collision with tail
    for segment in snake.segments[1:]:  # Skips the head
        if snake.head.distance(segment) < 10:
            scoreboard.reset()  # Keep the highest score, reset the base score
            snake.reset()       # Restart with a new snake
```

#### `scoreboard.py`
```py
class Scoreboard(Turtle):

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.score = 0          # Starting score
        self.high_score = 0     # Highest score
        self.color("white")     # Score text color
        self.penup()            # Prevent drawing lines when moving
        self.goto(0, 270)       # Position scoreboard at the top of the screen
        self.hideturtle()       # Hide the turtle icon
        self.update_scoreboard()  # Display initial score

    def update_scoreboard(self):
        """Clears previous score and updates the display with the current score and high score."""
        self.clear()
        self.write(f"Score: {self.score} | High Score: {self.high_score}", align=ALIGNMENT, font=FONT)

    # 8. Retain Highest Score
    def reset(self):
        """Resets the current score and updates the high score if a new record is reached."""
        if self.score > self.high_score:
            self.high_score = self.score
        self.score = 0
        self.update_scoreboard()

    def increase_score(self):
        """Increases the score by 1 and refreshes the scoreboard display."""
        self.score += 1
        self.update_scoreboard()
```

#### `snake.py`
```py
class Snake:
    def reset(self):
        """Resets the snake by clearing all segments and recreating it from the start."""
        for seg in self.segments:
            seg.goto(1000, 1000)  # Move old segments off-screen
        self.segments.clear()     # Remove all segments from the list
        self.create_snake()       # Recreate the initial snake
        self.head = self.segments[0]  # Reset the head reference
```

## Update 9: Read and Write the High Score to a File in Snake

**Date:** 20250318

**Objective:**  Implement persistent high score tracking by reading from and writing to a file, ensuring the highest score is saved across game sessions.

### Steps Completed:
1. **Implemented `with open()`** to handle file operations efficiently.
2. **Created `data.txt`** in the project root directory to store the highest score achieved.
3. **Added error handling** in `scoreboard.py` to initialize the high score to `0` if `data.txt` does not exist.
4. **Ensured automatic score persistence**â€”the game now saves the high score at the end of each session and loads it at the start of the next session.


### Code Highlights

#### `scoreboard.py`
```py
class Scoreboard(Turtle):

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.score = 0
        # ? Load high score from file; default to 0 if file is missing
        try:
            with open("data.txt") as data:
                self.high_score = int(data.read())
        except FileNotFoundError:
            self.high_score = 0
        # ...
    
    def reset(self):
        """Resets the current score and updates the high score if a new record is reached."""
        if self.score > self.high_score:
            self.high_score = self.score
            # ? Save the new high score to the file
            with open("data.txt", "w") as data:
                data.write(f"{self.high_score}")
        self.score = 0
        self.update_scoreboard()
```
