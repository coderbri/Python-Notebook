## Challenge 3: Draw Multiple Shapes with Turtle

This code uses Python's `turtle` graphics library to draw multiple polygons, starting with a triangle (3 sides) and ending with a decagon (10 sides). The function `draw_shape()` takes the number of sides as input, calculates the angle for turning at each corner, and draws the corresponding shape. For each polygon, the turtle's color is randomly selected from a predefined list of colors. The program sequentially draws these shapes, displaying them on the screen until the user clicks to exit.
