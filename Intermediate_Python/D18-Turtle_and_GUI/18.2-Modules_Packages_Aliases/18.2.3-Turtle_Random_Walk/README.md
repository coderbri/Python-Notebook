## Challenge 4: Make Turtle do a Random Walk Using Colors from a Dictionary

This code generates a **random walk** using Python's `turtle` graphics library. The turtle (`timmy`) moves forward in segments of 30 units while randomly choosing a new direction from four options: east (0째), north (90째), west (180째), or south (270째). The line color is randomly selected from a predefined list of colors, and the pen size is set to 10 for thicker lines. The turtle's movement is sped up with `speed("fast")`. The result is a colorful, random path displayed on the screen until the user clicks to exit.
