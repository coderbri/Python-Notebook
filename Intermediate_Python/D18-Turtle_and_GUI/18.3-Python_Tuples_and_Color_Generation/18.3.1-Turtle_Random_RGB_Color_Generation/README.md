## Challenge 5: Make Turtle do a Random Walk with Random RGB Colors

This code generates a **random walk** with randomly generated **RGB colors** using Python's `turtle` library. The `colormode(255)` enables RGB color mode, and the `generate_random_color` function creates a random color tuple `(r, g, b)` where each value is between 0 and 255. The turtle (`timmy`) moves forward in 30-unit segments, randomly choosing one of four directions: east (0째), north (90째), west (180째), or south (270째). The pen size is set to 10 for thicker lines, and the speed is set to "fastest" for quick drawing. The result is a colorful, random path displayed on the screen until the user clicks to exit.
