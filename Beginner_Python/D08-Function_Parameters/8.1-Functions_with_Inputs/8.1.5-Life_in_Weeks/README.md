# Life in Weeks Calculator

## Overview

This program calculates how many weeks a person has left to live if they are expected to live until 90 years old. It takes the user’s current age as input and outputs the remaining weeks.

## Function

The program includes a function, `life_in_weeks(age)`, which:
1. Defines `weeks_in_a_year` as 52.
2. Calculates `total_weeks` as the number of weeks in 90 years.
3. Determines how many weeks have passed for the user based on their age.
4. Calculates `weeks_left` by subtracting the weeks passed from the total weeks.
5. Prints the result in the format: `You have {weeks_left} weeks left.`

## Example

For an input age of `25`, the program outputs:
```
You have 3380 weeks left.
```
