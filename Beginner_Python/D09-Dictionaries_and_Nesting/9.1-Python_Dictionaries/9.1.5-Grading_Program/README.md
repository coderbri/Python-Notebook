# 9.1.5 Grading Program

This Python exercise is designed to demonstrate the use of dictionaries, iteration, and conditional statements to transform raw data into meaningful results.

## Overview
The goal of the program is to convert a set of student exam scores into descriptive grades based on specified criteria. The input data is provided as a dictionary called `student_scores`, where the keys are student names and the values are their exam scores. The program processes these scores and assigns each student a grade, creating a new dictionary called `student_grades` with the results.

## Scoring Criteria
The program uses the following criteria to convert scores to grades:
- **91 - 100**: "Outstanding"
- **81 - 90**: "Exceeds Expectations"
- **71 - 80**: "Acceptable"
- **70 or lower**: "Fail"

## Key Concepts
- **Dictionaries**: Used to store and access student scores and grades.
- **For Loops**: Used to iterate through the dictionary of student scores.
- **Conditional Statements**: Used to evaluate scores and determine the appropriate grade.

## Achievements
- Successfully iterated over a dictionary and accessed key-value pairs.
- Used conditional logic to assign meaningful grades to exam scores.
- Created a new dictionary that maps each student's name to their assigned grade, providing a clear and organized summary of their performance.

## Example Output
```py
{
    'Harry': 'Exceeds Expectations',
    'Ron': 'Acceptable',
    'Hermione': 'Outstanding',
    'Draco': 'Acceptable',
    'Neville': 'Fail'
}
```

This exercise reinforced Python fundamentals like data manipulation with dictionaries, loops, and conditionals.
